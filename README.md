## Note
This library is NOT intend to be getting new updates/features by me(Ramtin). 

I just shared the project to help people for their start.

This library won't publish to Nuget.org by me. 

Build this library by yourself. 
If you have problem with building it, try removing some platforms in the [FacebookApiSharp.csproj in line 4](https://github.com/ramtinak/FacebookApiSharp/blob/c67d0c208c3ee4ebdb643c015ffe7c06a891ace8/src/FacebookApiSharp/FacebookApiSharp.csproj#L4).

## Sample
You won't get any sample for this, this library is just like [InstagramApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp)'s library,
So, if you know how to use [InstagramApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp)'s library, you can use [FacebookApiSharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/FacebookApiSharp)'s library as well.

```C#
var userSession = new UserSessionData
{
    User = "Facebook Email or Phone number",
    Password = "Facebook Password"
};

IFacebookApi FacebookApi = FacebookApiBuilder.CreateBuilder()
    .SetUser(userSession)
    //.UseLogger(new FileDebugLogger(LogLevel.All))
    .UseLogger(new DebugLogger(LogLevel.All))
    .SetRequestDelay(RequestDelay.FromSeconds(0, 1))
    // Session handler, set a file path to save/load your state/session data
    .SetSessionHandler(new FileSessionHandler { FilePath = StateFile })

    //// Setting up proxy if you needed
    //.UseHttpClientHandler(httpClientHandler)
    .Build();

FacebookApi.SimCountry = FacebookApi.NetworkCountry = "us"; // lower case < us => united states
FacebookApi.ClientCountryCode = "US"; // most be upper case <US =>  united states
FacebookApi.AppLocale = FacebookApi.DeviceLocale = "en_US"; // if you want en_US , no need to set these


// load old session
FacebookApi.SessionHandler?.Load();

if (!FacebookApi.IsUserAuthenticated) // if we weren't logged in
{
    await FacebookApi.SendLoginFlowsAsync();

    var loginResult = await FacebookApi.LoginAsync();
    if (loginResult.Succeeded)// logged in
    {
        //// library will saves session automatically, so no need to do this:
        //FacebookApi.SessionHandler?.Save();
        Connected();
        // after we logged in, we need to sends some requests
        await FacebookApi.SendAfterLoginFlowsAsync();
    }
    else
    {
        switch (loginResult.Value)
        {
            case FacebookLoginResult.WrongUserOrPassword:
                MessageBox.Show("Wrong Credentials (user or password is wrong)");

                break;

            case FacebookLoginResult.RenewPwdEncKeyPkg:
                MessageBox.Show("Press login button again");
                break;
        }
    }
}
else
{
    Connected();
}
```
